<div class="title">American Checkers Rules</div>

<div class="textblock">This game adheres as closely as possible to the rules of American Checkers as published by the American Checker Federation. On each turn, one piece moves diagonally forward one square, or executes one or more diagonal forward jumps. A jump is possible if an opponent's piece occupies a diagonally adjacent square and the square on the other side of the opponent's piece is vacant. The jumped piece is removed from play. When a piece has traveled across the board to the last row, the piece is kinged. Kinged pieces can move and jump forwards and backwards, but still can only jump one piece at a time. A player is defeated when he or she has no more pieces, or cannot move any of his or her pieces.
</div>

<div class="title">Moving, Jumping and Double-Jumping</div>

<div class="textblock">To move a piece, simply touch the piece and drag it to its destination square. To jump an opponent, use the same gesture. To execute a double-jump, touch the piece and trace the path the piece should travel, from start to finish, without lifting your finger. An arrow will appear for each jump along the path. In this way multiple jumps can be executed with a single zig-zag gesture.
</div>

<div class="title">The Auto-Zoom Feature</div>

<div class="textblock">Because of the 3D perspective, farther squares are smaller than nearer squares on the board. The auto-zoom feature makes it easier to select distant pieces by automatically zooming-in when the player touches the far side of the board. This feature can be disabled by using the device's Settings application, and editing the 3D Checkers preferences.
</div>

<div class="title">Flying Kings</div>

<div class="textblock">In some variants of checkers, kinged pieces can jump over multiple opponent pieces. This rule, sometimes referred to as "Flying Kings," is not typically observed in American Checkers and is not enabled in 3D Checkers at this time.

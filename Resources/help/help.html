<div class="quote">"TO PRESERVE THE ORBITAL HARMONY OF OUR SYSTEM, THE DEFENSE OF BOTH PLANETS IS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY" </div>
<br>

<div class="title">PROTECT YOUR PLANETS</div>

<div class="textblock"> Use your planetary shield to deflect the enemy's attacks. When projectiles escape past your shield, your planet's health will decrease, eventually leading to the destruction of your cities. If either planet is destroyed, both planets will be knocked out of orbit and into oblivion. Planetary health can be determined from the condition of the cities along the edge of the screen:
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="smcity1.png"> <br> <span class="subtitle">YOUR PLANET IS HEALTHY</span></div>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="smcity2.png"> <br> <span class="subtitle">YOUR PLANET HAS TAKEN MODERATE DAMAGE</span></div>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="smcity3.png"> <br> <span class="subtitle">YOUR PLANET HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE</span></div>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="smcity4.png"> <br> <span class="subtitle">YOUR PLANET HAS TAKEN CRITICAL DAMAGE</span></div>
	<br>
	Prior to destruction, your planet will flash to indicate that it can only sustain one further hit. Your citizens will rebuild the planet, but only while they are protected from attack. 
</div><br>

<div class="title">WORK TOGETHER</div>

<div class="textblock">To defeat the aliens, you must collaborate with the defender of your allied planet. As a team, you can increase the potency of your attacks via these strategies:
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="redball.png"> <br> <span class="subtitle">SUPERCHARGED PROJECTILES</span><br>By volleying a projectile between the two shields, you can create a super-charged projectile. This will cut through large swaths of enemy forces.</div>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="slice.png"> <br> <span class="subtitle">TIME WARP</span><br>The last alien will emit a time-disrupting energy field. Our research indicates that this field is the alien's distress beacon, however it can be used to carefully direct projectiles towards the alien. Tilt the iPad to control the projectiles during a time warp.</div><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="bluePill2x.png"> <span class="subtitle">SUPER SHEILD</span><br>The cyan lifecapsule dropped from a dying alien you can extend your shield. However, in order to preserve the gravitational balance between planets, the other planet's shield will be reduced.</div><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="magPill2x.png"> <span class="subtitle">MULTI PROJECTILE</span><br>With the power of a magenta lifecapsule, each projectile that you reflect will spawn an additional projectile. With this capability, you will be able to do more damage to the enemy. However, be careful since those projectiles can also damage the planets.</div><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="redPill2x.png"> <span class="subtitle">SAFETY SHEILD</span><br>Juiced by a red lifecapsure, your shield will destroy projectiles on contact rather than reflect them. This will reduce the number of threatening projectiles, however it will also limit your ability to attack.</div><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="greenPill2x.png"> <span class="subtitle">AUTOFIRE</span><br>After absorbing a green lifecapsule, your shield will begin to fire super-charged projectiles automatically. While this capability will deliver significant damage to the enemy, it can also quickly destroy the other planet. Be sure your ally is ready!</div><br>
</div>

<div class="title">ALIEN MORPHOLOGY</div>

<div class="textblock">Aliens reproduce via cloning. Entire alien populations can be comprised of a single genetic individual. Though these aliens share the same DNA, they appear to have separate personalities. Some are equipped with armor which can absorb a single reflected projectile. The following is a list of the alien personas we have so far discovered:<br><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="prancesm.png"><div class="imggroup"><img src="prancearsm.png"> <span class="subtitle">ENSIGN PRANCE</span><br>The junior officer in the alien ranks, ENS Prance is capable of firing a single projectile. ENS Prance seems relatively docile, almost curious, excepting the deadly projectiles it emits. Our research team has recovered one relatively undamaged projectile, which they claim is a large communication device. However we all know that these are actually weapons of mass destruction.</div><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="waddlesm.png"><div class="imggroup"><img src="waddlearsm.png"> <span class="subtitle">LIEUTENANT WADDLE</span><br>LT Waddle seems just as friendly as the other aliens, but emits several potentially dangerous projectiles when killed. These projectiles are just as dangerous to other aliens as they are to your planet. Care should be taken when attacking this little dude.</div><br>
	<div class="imggroup"><img src="bobblesm.png"><div class="imggroup"><img src="bobblearsm.png"> <span class="subtitle">COMMANDER BOBBLE</span><br>CDR Bobble is much more aggressive than its comrades. It is capable of firing several projectiles at a time. Facing CDR Bobble is anything but a casual table-tennis match â€“ dispense with this alien as quickly as possible.</div><br>
	Unconfirmed reports suggest that there may be a limited number of larger aliens. Our scanners have picked up anomalies that suggest these aliens are twice the size of the more common varieties. Be on the lookout, and report any sightings immediately.
